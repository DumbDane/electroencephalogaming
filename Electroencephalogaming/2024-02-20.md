### Notes from meeting
Fourier transformation is basically taylor polynomials, at least for eeg. Important part to remember is that you're mapping from one space to another and back again. So you can e.g. go from power as a function of time into dB as a function of frequency (continuous hist) filter out bands and go back again.
We have been tasked with figuring out how to recreate the trials of our chosen dataset. Talk to kazakhstan girl.
