### Notes from meeting
Work with Enobio 8 API. 8 channels vs 13 is probably okay if our focus is making bci gaming more easily available, otherwise we go hard.

Baseline: bnci2015_1 or w/e
Improvement: Subject specific tuning or subject specific training
Fun aside: Test subject specific model cross subject / Play using each others model
