### Notes from meeting
Make a presentation on either BCI motor imagery techniques or MOABB, using review papers. MOABB higher priority.
Bring laptops to meetings so we can talk about notes.
Paolo sent us a motor imagery [[Motor Imagery Approach for BCI Game Development|paper]] on teams.
Sounded like Laurits thinks 

Instead of trying to find a dataset that matches our style of headset and configuration, we were recommended to find a dataset where we could replicate the experiment. Even if it's just on a subset of electrode placements, the model can always be trained on a subset of the original dataset.

Fourier transformation is when one wave is split into multiple. Comparing different bands is done across time to figure out which wave is dominant currently, e.g. if you wanna know if the brain is in alpha you don't compare how much gamma or beta activity there is currently, instead you look at a different point in time and compare with the alpha activity then.

Challenge paper supposedly would be a nice read, but maybe it's just because they explain basic eeg stuff.
