### Notes from meeting
They are not sure if they have anything that they can give us in terms of code. Laurits has a student who does something with MOABB datasets so he is going to talk to him. 
Filtering might be able to be done by the EEG directly (in real time).
Laurits thinks we don't have to do a trial setup that is as complicated as in the paper. He also thinks online is not necessary, we should start with training and then if we have time we can try and set up an actual testing scenario. 
In conclusion, I do not think they can give us any code ◠̈ . 
Library called PyLSL (look into that and also what LSL is in general). We can use that and psychopy to figure out a trial setup.
