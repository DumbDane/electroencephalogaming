### Notes from meeting

### Notes for next meeting
#### What did we achieve
* bullet points
#### What did we struggle with
* bullet points

#### What would we like to work on next week
* bullet points, try to give time estimates

#### Where do we need help from Paolo
* How do we get timestamps from the EEG, we purely get 8 channels of data but we do not get the timestamp or acceleration data
* How do we get alpha and beta bandwidth, supposedly the EEG can do it directly
* We could honestly not see much on the EEG, only major things such as I start to talk, but not blinking


Daily notes are supposed to be more specific
