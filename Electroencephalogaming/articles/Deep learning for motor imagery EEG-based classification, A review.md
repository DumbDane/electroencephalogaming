# Deep learning for motor imagery EEG-based classification, A review

### Abstract
>[!quote] The availability of large and varied Electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets, rapidly advances and inventions in [deep learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/deep-learning "Learn more about deep learning from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") techniques, and highly powerful and diversified computing systems have all permitted to easily analyzing those datasets and discovering vital information within. However, the classification process of EEG signals and discovering vital information should be robust, automatic, and with high accuracy. Motor Imagery (MI) EEG has attracted us due to its significant applications in daily life. This paper attempts to achieve those goals throughout a systematic review of the state-of-the-art studies within this field of research. The process began by intensely surfing the well-known specialized digital libraries and, as a result, 40 related papers were gathered. The papers were scrutinized upon multiple noteworthy technical issues, among them [deep neural network](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/deep-neural-network "Learn more about deep neural network from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") architecture, input formulation, number of MI EEG tasks, and frequency range of interest. Deep neural networks build robust and automated systems for the classification of MI EEG recordings by exploiting the whole input data throughout learning [salient features](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/salient-feature "Learn more about salient features from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). Specifically, [convolutional neural networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/convolutional-neural-network "Learn more about convolutional neural networks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (CNN) and hybrid-CNN (h-CNN) are the dominant architectures with high performance in comparison to public datasets with other types of architectures. The MI related datasets, input formulation, frequency ranges, and preprocessing and [regularization methods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/regularization-method "Learn more about regularization methods from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") were also reviewed. This review gives the required preliminaries in developing MI EEG-based [BCI](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/brain-computer-interface "Learn more about BCI from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") systems. The review process of the published articles in the last five years aims to help in choosing the appropriate deep neural network architecture and other hyperparameters for developing those systems.
