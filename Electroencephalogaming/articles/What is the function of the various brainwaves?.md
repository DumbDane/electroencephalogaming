# What is the function of the various brainwaves?

### Introduction
>[!quote] Ned Herrmann is an educator who has developed models of brain activity and integrated them into teaching and management training. Before founding the Ned Herrmann Group in 1980, he headed management education at General Electric, where he developed many of his ideas. Here is his explanation.

#### Four types of brain waves
**Beta waves**: Brain is aroused / engaged, fastest of the four type (15-40Hz) with low amplitude.
Examples of when in beta: Engaged in speech / debate.

**Alpha waves**: Brain is not aroused / engaged, low frequency (9-14Hz) with high amplitude
Examples of when in alpha: resting / meditating, a slow walk in the garden

**Theta waves**: Brain is engaged in daydreaming, lower frequency than alpha (5-8Hz) with higher amplitude.
Examples of when in theta: Forgetting the past 5km of a car ride, daydreaming at work, REM sleep

**Delta waves**: Brain is not in use, lowest frequency (2-4Hz) with highest amplitude of all
Examples of when in delta: Deep dreamless sleep.
