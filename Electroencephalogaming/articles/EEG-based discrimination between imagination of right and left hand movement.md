# EEG-based discrimination between imagination of right and left hand movement

### Abstract
>[!quote] Three subjects were asked to imagine either right or left hand movement depending on a visual cue stimulus. The interval between two consecutive imagination tasks was >10 s. Each subject imagined a total of 160 hand movements in each of 3–4 sessions (training) without feedback and 7–8 sessions with feedback. The EEG was recorded bipolarly from left and right central and parietal regions and was sampled at 128 Hz. In the feedback sessions, the EEG from both central channels was classified on-line with a neural network classifier, and the success of the discrimination between left and right movement imagination was given within 1.5 s by means of a visual feedback. For each subject, different frequency components in the alpha and beta band were found which provided best discrimination between left and right hand movement imagination. These frequency bands varied between 9 and 14 Hz and between 18 and 26 Hz. The accuracy of on-line classification was approximately 80% in all 3 subjects and did not improve with increasing number of sessions. By averaging over all training and over all feedback sessions, the EEG data revealed a significant desynchronisation (ERD) over the contralateral central area and synchronisation (ERS) over the ipsilateral side. The ERD/ERS patterns over all sessions displayed a relatively small intra-subject variability with slight differences between sessions with and without feedback.

- using learning vector quantisation (LVQ) as the classifier
    - works similar to nearest neighbours and gives a confidence level
- some people show an increase in EMG when imagining movement, while others don’t
- no significant increase in the classification accuracy was found with increasing number of test sessions
