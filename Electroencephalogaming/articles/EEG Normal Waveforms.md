# EEG Normal Waveforms

### Abstract
>[!quote] EEG activity reflects the temporal summation of the synchronous activity of millions of cortical neurons that are spatially aligned. Analyzing and interpreting the EEG is both an art and science. The normal EEG is extremely diverse and has a broad range of physiological variability. This activity illustrates EEG normal waveforms, and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care of patients who are evaluated by EEG.
