# State-of-the-Art

### Abstract
> [!quote] A comprehensive literature review of neural interfaces and devices was carried out to identify the key issues in this field. The main requirements and development complications were identified, and the various approaches used in past neural signals, interfaces, and models were reviewed. The review begins with a survey of existing neuromuscular signals and applications designed for human assistance. An overview of EEG and EMG based neural interfaces is also provided. This is followed by an analysis of the state-of-the-art in biomechanical, model-based, robot-control systems, with a primary focus on its applications to rehabilitation robots.
