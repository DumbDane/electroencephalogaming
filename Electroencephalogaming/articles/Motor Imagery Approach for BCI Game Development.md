# Motor Imagery Approach for BCI Game Development

### Abstract
>[!quote] Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a rapidly growing field with various applications in many domains such as medical, gaming and lifestyle. This paper presents a 3D non-invasive BCI game. Muse 2 headband is used for acquiring electroencephalogram (EEG) data and OpenViBE platform for processing the raw signals and classification. The game is developed in Unity game Engine. Several subjects are included in the study and EEG signals are recorded for three different mental states i.e. left and right Motor Imagery and eye blink, before playing the game for ten times, aiming to collect coins. Average classification result is 94.86% and average coins collected from the users is 30.8 out of 50 coins. Furthermore, longer periods of playing the game leads to increased control over the game.
