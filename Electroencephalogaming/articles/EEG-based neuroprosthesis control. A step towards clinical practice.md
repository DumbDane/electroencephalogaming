# EEG-based neuroprosthesis control: A step towards clinical practice

### Abstract
>[!quote] This case study demonstrates the coupling of an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) with an implanted neuroprosthesis (Freehand® system). Because the patient was available for only 3 days, the goal was to demonstrate the possibility of a patient gaining control over the motor imagery-based Graz BCI system within a very short training period. By applying himself to an organized and coordinated training procedure, the patient was able to generate distinctive EEG-patterns by the imagination of movements of his paralyzed left hand. These patterns consisted of power decreases in specific frequency bands that could be classified by the BCI. The output signal of the BCI emulated the shoulder joystick usually used, and by consecutive imaginations the patient was able to switch between different grasp phases of the lateral grasp that the Freehand® system provided. By performing a part of the grasp-release test, the patient was able to move a simple object from one place to another. The results presented in this work give evidence that Brain–Computer Interfaces are an option for the control of neuroprostheses in patients with high spinal cord lesions. The fact that the user learned to control the BCI in a comparatively short time indicates that this method may also be an alternative approach for clinical purposes.

One patient that tries to learn to control a BCI to be able to perform hand-grasping movements.
