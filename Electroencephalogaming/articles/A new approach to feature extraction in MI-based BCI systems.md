# A new approach to feature extraction in MI-based BCI systems

### Abstract
>[!quote] A motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) creates a path through which the brain interacts with the external environment by recording and processing [electroencephalograph](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/electroencephalograph "Learn more about electroencephalograph from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (EEG) signals made by imagining the movement of a particular limb. In this study, with the aim of improving [classification accuracy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/classification-accuracy "Learn more about classification accuracy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), we modified the feature extraction stage. After preprocessing and decomposing EEG signals into their frequency bands, we applied a [common spatial pattern](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/common-spatial-pattern "Learn more about common spatial pattern from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (CSP) algorithm to each subband. Then, using [spatial filters](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/spatial-filter "Learn more about spatial filters from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and [blind source separation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/blind-signal-separation "Learn more about blind source separation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (BSS) techniques, we identified features of brain sources rather than just channels. Finally, by selecting the appropriate features as the input of the classification block, we discerned the imagined classes. To evaluate our proposed method, we used the dataset IVa of BCI competition III, which includes two classes: right hand and foot. The results of various experiments explain that the accuracy of the system is on average 98.8% and the sensitivity is 100% for all subjects. This indicates that the proposed method can be used to improve the MI-based BCI."
