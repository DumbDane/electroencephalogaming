# Beamforming in Noninvasive Brain–Computer Interfaces

### Abstract
>[!quote] Spatial filtering (SF) constitutes an integral part of building EEG-based brain–computer interfaces (BCIs). Algo- rithms frequently used for SF, such as common spatial patterns (CSPs) and independent component analysis, require labeled train- ing data for identifying filters that provide information on a sub- ject’s intention, which renders these algorithms susceptible to over- fitting on artifactual EEG components. In this study, beamforming is employed to construct spatial filters that extract EEG sources originating within predefined regions of interest within the brain. In this way, neurophysiological knowledge on which brain regions are relevant for a certain experimental paradigm can be utilized to construct unsupervised spatial filters that are robust against ar- tifactual EEG components. Beamforming is experimentally com- pared with CSP and Laplacian spatial filtering (LP) in a two-class motor-imagery paradigm. It is demonstrated that beamforming outperforms CSP and LP on noisy datasets, while CSP and beam- forming perform almost equally well on datasets with few artifac- tual trials. It is concluded that beamforming constitutes an alter- native method for SF that might be particularly useful for BCIs used in clinical settings, i.e., in an environment where artifact-free datasets are difficult to obtain.
