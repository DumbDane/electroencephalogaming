# EEG-based BCI and video games: a progress report

### Abstract
>[!quote] This paper presents a systematic review of electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) used in the video games, a vibrant field of research that touches upon all relevant questions concerning the future directions of BCI. The paper examines the progress of BCI research with regard to games and shows that gaming applications offer numerous advantages by orienting BCI to concerns and expectations of a gaming application. Different BCI paradigms are investigated, and future directions are discussed.


# 1 Introduction

BCIs (brain-computer interfaces) emerged from electroencephalography (EEG). 

BCI interprets manifestations of complex brain mechanisms, enabling digital interface between the brain and the computer.

## 1.1 Importance of EEG

In EEG, the brain activity is detected in the form of weak electric potentials from the surface of the human scalp. 

BCI is categorised as invasive and noninvasive. Noninvasive BCI are categorised as “evoked” or “spontaneous”, as well as either synchronous or asynchronous. Furthermore, some make a distinction between BCIs based on externally triggered actions (exogenous) or user-initiated ones (endogenous). They can also be regarded as either dependent or independent based on the use (or nonuse) of peripheral neural pathways to establish control. 

The most prevalent approach is the active/passive/reactive categorisation, where active BCI is controlled directly, consciously and independently from external events. Passive BCIs rely on non-voluntary control for modulating the interaction with implicit information from the brain, while reactive BCIs rely on external stimuli.

## 1.2 Importance of games

It is evident that using games for BCI research provides a beneficial experimental environment, and on the other hand, through further advances in sensors and BCI research, the games will can be enriched by innovative game-play BCIs can provide.

# 2 Summary of EEG-based BCIs and games

BCIs are a weak replacement for traditional input, and that a big gap needs to be bridged between games in research and commercial games. (Bos et al)

# 3 Event-related/evoked potentials

Event-related potentials (ERPs) are electrical potentials generated by the brain that are related to specific internal or external events (e.g., stimuli, responses, decisions).

ERP modality is best suited for non-real-time control.

## 3.1 P300 event-related potential

P300 represents a positive peak observed in the EEG that represents cognitive processes of stimuli evaluation. The characteristic of the P300 peak is that it is much larger for infrequently occurring stimulus categories than for frequently occurring stimulus categories.

P300 is very robust considering it does not require user training and can be evoked as a response to auditory or tactile stimuli.

However, to detect the control signal the user has to be presented by the appropriate stimuli first, which can have a distracting effect, especially in a fast-paces game environment.

P300 only enables selection from a predefined set of commands. 

## 3.2 SSVEP

Steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) is a control paradigm where the user is presented with a flashing graphic of high contrast typically on a computer monitor.

The biggest problem in the SSVEP-based BCI is the fact that the band of easily detectable frequencies is very limited, so the number of controls that can be coded by different frequencies is also limited.

## 3.3 Other ERPs of interest

Different stimuli can be stacked for combined effect. 

A recent addition ot the available interaction modalities is the motion-onset VEP (mVEP) ERP which is evoked when the focused stimuli exhibits a movement.

Another interesting innovation in the way the stimuli is encoded is the codebook VEP (cVEP), where the stimuli do not follow the fixed frequency flashes as is the case with SSVEP, but flashes according to a pseudo-random binary sequence. This methodology promises to expand the number of different stimuli, since the span of usable flashing frequencies in a SSVEP-based system is restricted.

Slow Cortical potential (SCP) can be evoked from 300 ms to several seconds after stimuli onset. Mostly used in the therapeutic context as treatment to ADHD.

# 4 Oscillatory EEG

Event-related methodologies suffer from the dependency to outside stimulus to occur before a mental command can be issued. This prevents the user to initiate a command at will and hinders the intuitiveness of the interface. On the other hand, oscillatory-based BCI implement control by continually monitoring the frequency domain of the signal, thereby giving a continuous read out of brain activity. This rhythmic brain activity is constantly detectable and features in different wave bands: alpha (7.5–12 Hz), beta (12–30 Hz), gamma (31 Hz and above), delta (0.5–3.5 Hz), and theta
(3.5–7.5 Hz). The classifiers are used to distinguish between few classes based on either intensity of the band of interest or the lateralization of it (in the case of Motor Imagery). BCIs that monitor these oscillatory aspects of the signal establish control explicitly (such as in Motor Imagery) or implicitly through EEG signal monitoring of physiological and behavioral processes.

## 4.1 BCI for affective interaction and neurofeedback

Neural feedback (NF) presents one of the earliest forms of brain-computer interaction, which is concerned with representing the neural activity to the patient, with the aim of training the user to modulate it. Repeated modulation of brain activity in this has been shown to be an effective therapeutic tool (normalising brain activity to influence symptoms), performance tool in healthy participants (e.g., meditation training), and as an experimental tool to examine neural events in the context of cognition and behaviour. 

Many of the studies done using neurofeedback used commercial EEGs. 

## 4.2 Motor imagery

Another invaluable tool in the BCI control modality toolbox is motor imagery (MI). MI is a special case of NF, where the subjects imagined movement can be detected through monitoring the oscillatory activity in the Mu rhythm, and then be used to facilitate navigation and control.

MI modality does not depend on outside-initiated stimuli to facilitate signal detection, although certain stimuli presentation is used in a training process prior to the control session. However, if there is movement occurring during BCI operation, the muscle artifacts would render the interface unusable in most cases. 

## 4.3 Hybrid interfaces

Most of the research into BCI used BCI as the only channel for communication. But the performance depends highly on, for example, the noise in the environment. Therefore, it makes sense to enrich the interaction with other inputs (such as an eye tracker, or another biofeedback channel) in order to mitigate some difficulties implementing an exclusively BCI game. Hybrid BCI is defined as pure hybrid BCIs that combine two or more BCI paradigms, physiological hybrid BCIs, which combine a BCI with another physiological signal, or mixed hybrid BCIs, which combine a BCI with non-physiological input.

# 5 Discussion

BCI causes a high level of fatigue and demands high concentration or attention to stimulus. It has a very low information transfer rate. 

BCI devices are inaccessible and there also are not a lot of attractive applications or games. 

The developers of BCI games should consider leveraging all the flexibility of the rich graphical environment in order to integrate the triggering stimuli in a non-distracting way. 

# 6 Conclusion

Most BCI research of today is far from applications for healthy persons.
