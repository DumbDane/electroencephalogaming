# EEG-based BCI and video games, a progress report

### Abstract
>[!quote] This paper presents a systematic review of electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) used in the video games, a vibrant field of research that touches upon all relevant questions concerning the future directions of BCI. The paper examines the progress of BCI research with regard to games and shows that gaming applications offer numerous advantages by orienting BCI to concerns and expectations of a gaming application. Different BCI paradigms are investigated, and future directions are discussed.
