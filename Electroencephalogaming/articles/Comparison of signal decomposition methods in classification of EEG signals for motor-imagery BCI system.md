# Comparison of signal decomposition methods in classification of EEG signals for motor-imagery BCI system

### Abstract
>[!quote] In this study, three popular signal processing techniques (Empirical Mode Decomposition, Discrete Wavelet Transform, and Wavelet Packet Decomposition) were investigated for the decomposition of Electroencephalography (EEG) Signals in Brain Computer Interface (BCI) system for a classification task. Publicly available BCI competition III dataset IVa, a multichannel 2-class motor-imagery dataset, was used for this purpose. Multiscale Principal Component Analysis method was applied for the purpose of noise removal. In addition, different sets of features were formed to examine the effect of a particular group of features. The parameter selection process for signal decomposition methods was thoroughly explained as well. Our results show that the combination of Multiscale Principal Component Analysis de-noising and higher order statistics features extracted from wavelet packet decomposition sub-bands resulted in highest average classification accuracy of 92.8%. Our study is one among very few that provides a comprehensive comparison between signal decomposition methods in combination with higher order statistics in classification of BCI signals. In addition, we stressed the importance of higher frequency ranges in improving the classification task for EEG signals in Brain Computer Interface Systems. Obtained results indicate that the proposed model has the potential to obtain a reliable classification of motor imagery EEG signals, and can thus be used as a practical system for controlling a wheelchair. It can also further enhance the current rehabilitation therapies where appropriate feedback is delivered once the individual executes the correct movement. In that way, motor rehabilitation outcomes may improve over time.
