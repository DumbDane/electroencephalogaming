## TO-DOs
## Important
- [x] Write e-mail to FM for access to 5th floor @DR (CC Paolo)
- [x] Make presentation on MOABB and how we can use it in our project.

## Wants
- [ ] Find more papers on motor imagery
- [ ] Get the headset on
- [ ] Figure out if you can use other things than ears as baseline

## Boring
