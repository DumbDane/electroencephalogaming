### Notes from meeting
They are not sure if they have anything that they can give us in terms of code. Laurits has a student who does something with MOABB datasets so he is going to talk to him. 
Filtering might be able to be done by the EEG directly (in real time).
Laurits thinks we don't have to do a trial setup that is as complicated as in the paper. He also thinks online is not necessary, we should start with training and then if we have time we can try and set up an actual testing scenario. 
In conclusion, I do not think they can give us any code ◠̈ . 
Library called PyLSL (look into that and also what LSL is in general). We can use that and psychopy to figure out a trial setup. 

### Notes for next meeting
#### What did we achieve
* made psychopy experiment
#### What did we struggle with
* psychopy

#### What would we like to work on next week
* implement classifier, get EEG on?

#### Where do we need help from Paolo
* Which mode would we use the EEG in?
* What would we use LSL for? Is it for the training part already?


### Tuesday notes
What did we do today?
We got psychopy to work with randomised the arrow direction through the application but could not get the code to run through python.

How long did we spend on lunch?
stopped before lunch

How much time did we spend actively working?
4.5h

What are we doing next time?
Continue working on psychopy

### Wednesday Notes
What did we do today?
We added a trial number variable to our experience. 

How long did we spend on lunch?
2h

How much time did we spend actively working?
2h

What are we doing next time?

### Thursday Notes
What did we do today?
We found out the EEG can filter bands in real-time.
We finished the psychopy experiment.

How long did we spend on lunch?
lunch at work

How much time did we spend actively working?
2h

What are we doing next time?
Code a classifier. Take the data we have and translate it into something we can use.
