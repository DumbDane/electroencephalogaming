#### What would we like to work on next week
* bullet points, try to give time estimates

#### Where do we need help from Paolo
* the template mentions our new contributions, we don't really have any and you had also said how that is a bit out of scope for a bach proj so what do we write there?
* how do we cite the enobio -> either find citation type that fits or put footnote with link to device. for example use software, put company as programmer and put a url
* to what extent are we doing numbered sections in our report. template makes it almost sound like we're putting bullet points for the discussion and conclusion section
* how do recurring citations work? if i'm talking about using 10-10 system in background, and mention 10-10 system as limitation in discussion, do i need to cite it again. ALSO with the paper we were trying to mimic. -> always cite the external
* why the fuck does our thing not converge
* contribution: verifying and testing other research or smth
