## Research Questions

Different experiments would be: 
* seeing if classifiers trained on exclusively external EEG data can can be used by us 
* Seeing if a classifier trained on data from one of us performs better/worse on the other, does one of our brains generalise better?
* Seeing if we can use the personal training data to tune the classifier trained on external data, will this cut training costs?

RQ:
Will EEG data from other people help in the classification of EEG data from a single person?
