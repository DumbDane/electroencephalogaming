# Understanding brain waves

### Introduction
>[!quote] Neurofeedback training is based on the principle of operant conditioning, which involves rewarding an individual for inhibiting certain brain waves and increasing others, depending on their levels of cortical arousal.  An audio or visual stimulus is used for reinforcement during most NF training protocols. Certain frequencies of brain waves are inhibitory, whilst others are excitatory.  This means that the stimulation of certain wave bands may be responsible for characteristics associated with over-arousal (e.g. fidgeting, hyperactivity and feelings of agitation), whilst others lead to features of under-arousal (e.g. poor concentration, spaciness, and day-dreaming)


#### Overproduction of brainwaves 
**Delta Overproduction**: Can lead to learning disabilities, ADHD and in general makes it difficult to focus. When sleeping, sleep walking and sleep talking are result of an overproduction

**Theta Overproduction**: Can lead to feeling scatterbrained of day-dreamy, commonly reported in ADHD. _conjecture:_ Overproduction in the left hemisphere leads to lack of organisation, while for right leads to impulsivity.
side note: Theta waves are often seen front part of brain for attention disorder people. Anxiety kills "frontal midline theta" waves generated in the hippocampus.

**Alpha Overproduction**: Has no issues, true issue is actually when too low, for right hemisphere this is correlated with social withdrawal, for frontal it is seen in people with depression. 

**Beta Overproduction**: Can lead to difficulty sleeping and opposite to Alpha waves, Beta waves are most common in left hemisphere and an excess can be correlated with mania. High right hemisphere beta was found to be correlated with anxiety. Lastly, temporal lobe and central beta are correlated with insomnia and migraines respectively.
side note: Beta waves can be sorted into three levels, (12-15), (15-22) and  (22-38). musing thought, high engagement and complex thought respectively.

**Gamma Waves**: Highest frequency of all waves (30-100Hz), higher is correlated with memory, IQ, compassion and happiness. Currently difficult to measure due to noise from muscle activation.t
Examples of when in gamma: peak concentration and high levels of cognitive function.

**Gamma Overproduction**: Like alpha, the issues are actually a lack of gamma waves, being correlated with low memory and impaired mental processing (potentially leading to learning difficulties).
