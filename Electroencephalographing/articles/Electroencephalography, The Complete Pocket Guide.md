# Electroencephalography: The Complete Pocket Guide

### Abstract

# Brain, mind & behaviour

EEG has a high time resolution and thus makes it easier to capture events that only span hundreds of milliseconds to a few seconds than it would be with other brain imaging techniques (MRI or PET scanner for example).

## Brain regions and their functions

### The Cerebrum 
The Cerebrum or cortex is the forward-most portion and largest part of the human brain. It is associated with conscious thought, and sensory processing. It consists of two hemispheres, connected through the corpus callosum.
### The Cerebellum
Means "little brain". It also has two hemispheres but with highly folded surfaces. It plays part in the regulation and control of fine movements, posture and balance.

### The Brainstem
The lower and oldest part of the brain. It controls body processes such as heartbeat, breathing, bladder function, and sense of equilibrium (meaning anything that should happen automatically).
### The Limbic System
It includes the thalamus, hypothalamus and amygdala. It is often referred as the "emotional brain" and plays a central role in arousing fight-or-flight situations.

There are not as many differences between the two hemispheres as commonly believed. A basic division is made between 4 lobes: occipital, temporal, parietal, and frontal. 
### The Occipital Lobe
- visual processing centre of our brain
- located in the rearmost portion of the skull
- everything we see is processed here

### The Temporal Lobe 
- processing sensory input to derived meanings using visual memories, language and emotional associating
- responsible for long-term memory
- left temporal cortex involved in comprehension of written and spoken language

### The Parietal Lobe
- integrating information from external sources as well as internal sensory feedback (from muscles, limbs, head, eyes, etc.)
- responsible for merging all these sources into a coherent representation of how our body relates to the environment and how the environment spatially relates to us

### The Frontal Lobe
- most conscious thoughts and decisions made here
- controls voluntary movements
- contains most of the dopamine-sensitive neurones

## Neural activation and electrical fields
Not all electrical fields that are generated by neurones are strong enough to travel to the skull surface. It is primarily the synchronised activity of pyramidal neurones in cortical brain regions that can be measured from the outside.
## EEG signals
EEG recordings are done with electrode arrays. It measures electrical signals. Since those signals are very small, the data is sent to an amplifier. 

### Frequency, power & phase
Frequency is the speed of an oscillation, measured in Hertz. Power is the amount of energy in a frequency band, expressed as squared amplitude. Phase is the amount of synchronisation across several generators (neurones, people). 

## Bands in the brain
Delta band (1 – 4 Hz), theta band (4 – 8 Hz), alpha band (8 – 12 Hz), beta band (13 – 25 Hz) and gamma band (> 25 Hz).

### Delta band (1-4 Hz)
- slowest and highest amplitude brainwaves
- usually only present during deep non-REM sleep (slow wave sleep)
- stronger in the right brain (source: thalamus)
- play a core role in biographic memory, acquired skills and learned information
### Theta band (4-8 Hz)
- frontal theta correlates with the difficulty of mental operations
- become more prominent with increased task difficulty
### Alpha band (8-12 Hz)
- increased levels of alpha band power during mental and physical relaxation with eyes closed
- alpha power is suppressed during mental or body activity with eyes open
- alpha suppression indicates the brain gearing up to pick up information from various senses
### Beta band (12-25 Hz)
- higher beta power $\rightarrow$ active, busy or anxious thinking as well as active concentration
- along the motor strip, beta power becomes stronger as we plan or execute movements but also when observing the movements of others
### Gamma band (above 25 Hz)
- unclear where they are generated and what their role is
# Collecting EEG data
The best type of electrodes for recording clean data are wet electrodes. The material of the electrode matters since some materials corrode faster than others. Dry electrodes are faster to apply but more prone to motion artefacts. 
## Electrode arrays and placement
The most common systems are 10-20 and 10-5. Important points in the 10-20 system are:
- Nasion (Nz): depression between eyes at top of nose
- Inion (Iz): bump at the back of the head
- Left and right pre-auricular points
The vertical line connecting nasion and inion as well as the horizontal line connecting left and right pre-auricular points are now divided into ten equal sections.
Electrode names begin with one or two letters, indicating the region or lobes:
- Fp: frontopolar
- F: frontal
- C: central
- P: parietal
- O: occipital
- T: temporal
The name ends with a number, indicating the distance to the midline. Odd numbers are used on the left and even ones on the right. Electrodes in the middle are labeled with a "z" for zero.

## Reference and ground electrode (and some math)
EEG voltage reflects the potential (or current) between the site and the ground electrode (G). The ground electrode is connected to the ground circuit in the amplifier, so there's always some electrical noise introduced. To overcome this, there is a reference electrode R. The difference between R and G is also recorded by the amplifier. The output of the amplifier is the electrical potential between the recording side and the reference electrode.
## Electrode impedance
The electrical resistance (due to dead skin cells, sweat, etc.) is called impedance and measured in units of Ohm.The impedances should be as low as possible.
## Signal digitisation, amplification and forwarding
EEG systems take discrete snapshots of the continuous fluctuations of voltages. The sampling rate depends on the EEG and is expressed in samples per second in Hertz. 
>[!quote] Nyquist theorem: All of the information in an analog signal (like EEG voltages) can be captured digitally as long as the sampling rate is more than twice as great as the highest frequency of interest in the signal.
## Clean EEG data and artefacts
It is important to avoid, minimise or at least control these kinds of artifacts:
-  Muscle activity (EMG, ECG)
	- The closer the muscles are to the electrodes, the stronger their impact on the recording. 
- Eye movements
	- Eye movements affect the electrical fields picked up by the electrodes
- Blinks
## External sources of artefacts
1. Movement of an electrode or headset movements
2. Line noise 
3. Swaying and swinging
# EEG analysis: Metrics and features
## Event-related potentials (ERPs)
The goal of event-related EEG paradigms is to collect the brain processes which are triggered by external stimuli. The logic behind event-related EEG studies:
1. When you present a stimulus, you trigger stimulus-related EEG activity.
2. The stimulus is shown several times. Selection of data portions from continuous EEG recordings is called epoching or segmentation
3. By averaging the EEG time-courses of all trials, only the stimulus-related EEG activity survives.
4. Remaining EEG waveform is the event-related potential
ERPS can be described by: appearance and shape, number, latency, amplitudes of the "wiggles", ERP components (positive and negative peaks) and topography.
## Frequency-based analysis of EEG data
Frequency analyses are more closely linked to physiological processes and brain structures than ERPs. Less data is required to arrive at conclusions, but they have less time precision.
Frequency-based analyses are recommended whenever testing time is limited and your analysis is not about the precise timing of stimulus-related activity but rather about the general mental, affective or cognitive state of the respondent.
### The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
FFT transforms the EEG signal into the frequency domain.

## Cognitive-affective metrics
Whenever brain-based workload or drowsiness levels exceed a specified threshold value, there can be a notification to instantiate some counteraction. The two metrics used are cognitive states and workload.

# EEG and multimodal research
You can add other sensors to EEG:
- eye tracking (especially useful when visual stimuli are part of the research, pupil dilation is good to measure for arousal)
- ECG/PPG  (heart rate allows to track physical state, anxiety and stress levels; makes sense for decontamination procedures as heart beats can cause strong artefacts in EEG data)
- Facial expression analysis
