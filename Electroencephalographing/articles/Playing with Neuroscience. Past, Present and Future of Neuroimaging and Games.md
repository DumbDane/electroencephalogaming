# Playing with Neuroscience: Past, Present and Future of Neuroimaging and Games

### Abstract
>[!quote] Videogames have been a catalyst for advances in many research fields, such as artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction or virtual reality. Over the years, research in fields such as artificial intelligence has enabled the design of new types of games, while games have often served as a powerful tool for testing and simulation. Can this also happen with neuroscience? What is the current relationship between neuroscience and games research? what can we expect from the future? In this article, we'll try to answer these questions, analysing the current state-of-the-art at the crossroads between neuroscience and games and envisioning future directions.

Paper talks about the fields of AI, neuroscience, and games and how they can be mutually beneficial to each other. In particular mentioning the advantage games could offer in creating more "ecologically valid neuroscientific research".
