# EEG-Based Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI)

### Abstract
>[!quote] Recent emerging research in the area of cognitive neuroscience computing provides a strong foundation toward the development of brain-computer interfaces. These brain-computer interfacing (BCI) systems have been evolved to provide tremendous applications including neuro-prosthetics (robotic arms/hands), hands free mind controlling applications without any muscle interventions through interpretation of thoughts/feelings. These applications are not only developed to provide aid to medically challenged people, but also may provide assistance to healthy users too in their routine and occupational work. This chapter provides a comprehensive review of emerging research in BCI development techniques. The perspectives of distinct BCI development modalities, viz._,_ electroencephalography (EEG), electrocorticography (ECoG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), their acquisition considering the complex brain anatomy, linear and [nonlinear signal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/nonlinear-signal "Learn more about nonlinear signal from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") analysis methods followed by classification techniques followed to classify brain responses have been discussed in detail. Focus has been paid to review the technologies used to develop EEG-based inexpensive, portable, and more intuitive brain-computer interfaces for control applications.
