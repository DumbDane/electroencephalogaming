# EEG-based continuous control of a game using a 3 channel motor imagery BCI

### Abstract
>[!quote] This paper presents an overview of a multistage signal processing framework to tackle the main challenges in continuous control protocols for motor imagery based synchronous and self-paced BCIs. The BCI can be setup rapidly and automatically even when conducting an extensive search for subject-specific parameters. A new BCI-based game training paradigm which enables assessment of continuous control performance is also introduced. A range of offline results and online analysis of the new game illustrate the potential for the proposed BCI and the advantages of using the game as a BCI training paradigm.

The user in this study keeps continuous control over the game, as they're playing as a spaceship that has to avoid asteroids.
